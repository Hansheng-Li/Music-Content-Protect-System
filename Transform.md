# Summary of Python string operations

Python is very powerful when it comes to handling strings, providing a wealth of methods to perform various string operations. Here are some examples of basic and advanced string manipulation methods:

## Basic operations

1. `split`: Split the string into a list.
2. `join`: Concatenate the elements in the list into a string.
3. Specify the number of splits: Specify the number of splits when using `split`.
4. `rsplit`: Split starting from the right side of the string.
5. Split lines: Use `splitlines` to split multi-line strings.
6. `partition`: Split the string into three parts.
7. `rpartition`: Similar to `partition`, but starts from the right.
8. `replace`: Replace some parts of the string.
9. Case conversion: Use `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `title` for case conversion.
10. Remove whitespace: Use `strip`, `lstrip`, `rstrip` to remove whitespace characters on both sides of the string.

## Advanced operations

11. String formatting (`format`): Use the `format` method to insert values into the placeholders of a string.
12. String prefix and suffix check (`startswith`, `endswith`): Check whether the string starts with a specific prefix or ends with a specific suffix.
13. Find substring (`find`, `rfind`): Find the first occurrence of a substring.
14. Character filling (`zfill`): Fill the left side of a numeric string with `0`.
15. String slicing: The slicing operation can be used to obtain a part of a string.
16. Reverse strings: Use slicing to reverse strings.
17. Variants of `strip` (`lstrip`, `rstrip`): Remove whitespace characters (or other characters) on the left or right side of the string.
18. String iteration: Iterate each character in the string directly in the `for` loop.
19. String inclusion check (`in`): Check whether a string contains another string.

These operations form the basic toolset for processing Python strings and can cover most string operation needs.
